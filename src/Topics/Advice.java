	/* ADVICE

	ANXIETY, STRESS

	Writing about how you feel is helpful for a lot of people. If your thoughts or worries are down on paper, you don't need to hold them in your head. You can always come back to them when you're ready.

	

	DEPRESSION, ANXIETY

	Sometimes we have negative thoughts that we can't help. Ask yourself "Is this thought helpful for me right now?" If it's not helpful, it's okay to let it go.

	

	Sometimes a negative thought comes out of nowhere. It's okay to let the thought sit with you for awhile, without judgement. Consider what it might be showing you. Then, when you're ready, let the thought go.

	

	ANXIETY, ANGER

	Sometimes we get carried away, or stuck in our own heads. Take a break, breathe, and focus on how your body feels. Feel your breath moving in and out, the ground beneath you, the environment you're in. This will help bring your attention back to yourself and the moment.

	

	ANXIETY, ANGER, STRESS, INSOMNIA

	Exercise is an important aspect of self-care. When you're feeling {characteristic}, try going for a walk or doing some simple stretches, or a more vigorous workout if you're up for it. Your body will release positive endorphins, and it's a great chance to reset.

	

	DEPRESSION, STRESS

	It's easy to get so overwhelmed that you can't do anything at all. Pick one simple task to do right away, like getting yourself a glass of water or placing clothes in a laundry basket. It's easier to start with something easy, then even if you can't do anything else, you've still made progess.

	

	INSOMNIA

	It's important to dedicate time before bed ot wind down. Avoid screens, or turn on blue light filters, and get to bed at the same time every night.

	

	IF ANY CHARACTERISTIC HAS LARGE EDGE WEIGHTS

	I can't give advice for every issue, but I recommend seeking out a professional counsellor.
